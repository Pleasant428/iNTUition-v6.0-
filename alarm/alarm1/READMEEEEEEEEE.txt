Hi we are pod4! We have created an alarm clock to wake people who have trouble waking up. When you run main.py, the whack-a-mole game(Alarm3.py) will run. Users have to drag the mouse across the screen and click on the clock that's running around. Score 5 points to unlock/snooze successfully. If you did not get 5 points before 10 seconds, we give you second chance with another game!! Which will run immediately after the 10 seconds has passed.

Second game is connect-the-squares(newmain.py). click and drag the mouse across all red boxes which will turn green. However, you have to complete your drawing at the starting position within 10 seconds(MUST BE PRECISE!!!). If all else fails, your friend will be notified by a text message(sendMessage.py) to wake you up physically!! (when the message is sent, terminal will display the confirmation code SM03c4c887e32449b3a2e5f777872f2482. This code is a phone number belonging to one of us, generated by twilio API.)
